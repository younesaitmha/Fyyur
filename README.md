Fyyur
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

I build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Overview

This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thing… real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, you should have a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

The Fyyur app can be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
```
> **Note** - If we do not mention the specific version of a package, then the default latest stable package will be installed.

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```


## Main Files: Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependencies
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── models.py *** Contains SQLAlchemy models.
  ├── forms.py *** Contains forms
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  ├── static
  │   ├── css
  │   ├── font
  │   ├── ico
  │   ├── img
  │   └── js
  └── templates
      ├── errors
      ├── forms
      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `models.py` file.
* Controllers are located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- (Already complete.) Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- (Already complete.) Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- (Already complete.) Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- (Already complete.) Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `models.py` -- (Already complete.) Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- (Already complete.) Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.

### How to contribute?

Looking to go above and beyond? This is the right section for you! Here are some challenges to make your contribution stand out:

* Implement artist availability. An artist can list available times that they can be booked. Restrict venues from being able to create shows with artists during a show time that is outside of their availability.
* Implement Search Artists by City and State, and Search Venues by City and State. Searching by "San Francisco, CA" should return all artists or venues in San Francisco, CA.
* Showcase what albums and songs an artist has on the Artist’s page.

Best of luck in your final project! Fyyur depends on you!

## Development Setup

1. **Download the code**
```
git clone https://github.com/younesaitmha/Fyyur.git
cd Fyyur/
```

2. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

1. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

6. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
